# **Glide Distance**

With Both Engines failed, the aircraft will glide approximately 6 nautical miles for each 5000 feet AGL. The recommended glide airspeed for maximum range with both engines out is 215 knots. This speed will allow the windmilling engines to maintain power control hydraulic pressures within safe limits but not be optimum for airstart.
