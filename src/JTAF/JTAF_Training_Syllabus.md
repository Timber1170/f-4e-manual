# **JTAF F-4E Training Syllabus Courses**

The training structure for the JTAF F-4E aircraft includes a series of courses designed to meet the needs and learning objectives of different types of DCS users. These courses are further divided into five main categories: Orientation and General Information (X Series), The Basic Course (B Series), The Advanced Course (A Series), The Instructor Course (I Series), and The Weapons School (W Series).

## Training Structure

#### Courses
- [Orientation and General Information  (X Series)](./JTAF_Training_Syllabus.md#orientation-and-general-information-x-series)
- [The Basic Course  (B Series)](./JTAF_Training_Syllabus.md#basic-course-structure)
- [The Advanced Course  (A Series)](./JTAF_Training_Syllabus.md#the-advanced-course-a-series)
- [The Instructor Course  (I Series)](./JTAF_Training_Syllabus.md#the-instructor-course-i-series)
- [The Weapons School  (W Series)](./JTAF_Training_Syllabus.md#the-weapons-school-w-series)

All new members to the squadron, regardless of their preferred airframe, must complete Orientation (X001) as soon as possible after joining the squadron. They can also choose to complete the course before officially joining as part of the interview process.

#### Subject Areas

Each series of courses is organized into subject areas, which are covered in the respective course section. The general pattern is:

* **1xx**: Ground operations, planning, and orientation
* **2xx**: Flight operations
* **3xx**: Aircraft Systems

#### Qualifications and Promotions

If the F-4E is chosen as the member's primary airframe:

* Completion of the Basic Course confers the Basic Qualification rating and promotion to 1LT.
* Completion of the Advanced Course confers the Mission Qualification rating and promotion to CAPT.

#### Optional Courses

Further courses are optional and offered to those who want to go "deep" into the F-4E Phantom or take on additional roles in the Squadron.

#### Activities

Activities are broken down as follows:

* **Review**: Review material with an officer/instructor and be able to respond to review questions if asked.
* **Demonstrate**: Perform briefed actions in the aircraft, under observation, in an environment conducive to the exercise.
* **Brief**: Simple passing of information. No actions needed.

## [The Basic Course (B-Series)](./B-Course/overview.md)

The Basic Course is intended for people who are new to DCS and the F-4E may be their first module or they are new to flight simulators in general. It is also intended for those moving up from less sophisticated aircraft (such as the MiG-3, FC3, etc.) and need to learn how to use a heavy smoking 2-seat multirole aircraft. It can also be used for a refresher if returning to the aircraft after a period of time.

#### Basic Course Structure
The Basic Courses are structured in the following way:

* [**B1xx**](./JTAF_Training_Syllabus.md#b101---aircraft-orientation) - Basic Aircraft and Weapons Orientation
