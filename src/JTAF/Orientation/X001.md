# JTAF Squadron Orientation

#### JTAF’S Role in vTF-77

*   JTAF will assist other squadrons in training that will directly interact with JTAF members. If able, fully trained members will provide their services to help other members pass / qualify. This can include things such as, BFM Fights, BVR fights, fly opposition for missions, etc.
*   JTAF will provide opposition in live red vs. blue campaigns to provide a simulated and fun aggressor experience.
*   The role of JTAF is not necessarily to win, but to provide training services to our blue counterparts and an aggressor force in mission.
    +   *You will be out-manned, outgunned, using older and oftentimes inferior equipment.*

#### Code of Conduct

*   We do not allow registrations from anyone under the age of 18.
*    When flying in other public servers with our tag, you will abide by the server’s rules. As a member of JTAF and vTF-77 you are representing us to the DCS community.
*   During mission briefings and debriefs, allow the speaker to go over their content and wait until the floor is open for questions or you are called upon.
*   Remember when posting in another squadron’s channel you are in their house. Nobody likes a house guest that complains about the furniture.
