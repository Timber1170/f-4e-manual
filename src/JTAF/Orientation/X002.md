# JTAF Mission Explanation

#### JTAFâ€™S Role in vTF-77

*   JTAF will assist other squadrons in training that will directly interact with JTAF members. If able, fully trained members will provide their services to help other members pass / qualify. This can include things such as, BFM Fights, BVR fights, fly opposition for missions, etc.
*   JTAF will provide opposition in live red vs. blue campaigns to provide a simulated and fun aggressor experience.
*   The role of JTAF is not necessarily to win, but to provide training services to our blue counterparts and an aggressor force in mission.
    +   *You will be out-manned, outgunned, using older and oftentimes inferior equipment.*
